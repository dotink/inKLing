# Give Your StyleSheets a Clue

inkling is a small CSS "framework" which provides helpful resets and defaults to
make your styling faster.  It uses the good ideas from HTML5 (new element names)
as class names and adds some additional suggested classes with default styling
that makes many tasks a breeze.

## Goals
* Keep things as semantic as possible
* Don't do too much
* Provide sane defaults and strong suggestions
